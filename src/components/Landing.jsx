          A disaster is an unforeseen and often catastrophic event that causes
          widespread destruction, disruption, and distress, overwhelming the
          affected community's ability to cope using its normal resources. These
          events can be natural, such as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, or
          wildfires, or they can be human-made, including industrial accidents,
          technological failures, or armed conflicts. Disasters can result in
          significant loss of life, damage to infrastructure, displacement of
          populations, and long-term economic and environmental consequences.
          Effective disaster management involves proactive measures in
          mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery to minimize the
          impact and enhance resilience in the face of such adversities.
          Disaster management involves a comprehensive approach that encompasses
          preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery strategies.
          Mitigation efforts aim to reduce the impact of disasters by
          implementing preventive measures, while preparedness involves
          planning, training, and raising awareness to enhance the ability to
          respond swiftly and efficiently when a disaster occurs. The response
          phase involves immediate actions to save lives, protect property, and
          alleviate suffering, while recovery focuses on rebuilding and
          restoring affected communities to a state of normalcy.
